// Make a Weapon class, that has a type string, and a getType that returns a const
// reference to this string. Also has a setType.
// Now, create two classes, HumanA and HumanB, that both have a Weapon, a name, and
// an attack() function that displays something like:
// NAME attacks with his WEAPON_TYPE
// Make it so the following code produces attacks with "crude spiked club" THEN "some
// other type of club", in both test cases:


int main()
{
	{
		Weapon club = Weapon("crude spiked club");
		HumanA bob("Bob", club);
		bob.attack();
		club.setType("some other type of club");
		bob.attack();
	}
	{
		Weapon club = Weapon("crude spiked club");
		HumanB jim("Jim");
		jim.setWeapon(club);
		jim.attack();
		club.setType("some other type of club");
		jim.attack();
	}
}


// In which case is it appropriate to store the Weapon as a pointer? As a reference?
// Why? Is it the best choice in light of whatâ€™s asked? These are the questions you should
// ask yourself before turning in this exercise.
