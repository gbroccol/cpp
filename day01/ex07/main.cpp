// Make a program called replace that takes a filename and two strings, let’s call them
// s1 and s2, that are NOT empty.
// It will open the file, and write its contents to FILENAME.replace, after replacing
// every occurence of s1 with s2.
// Of course, you will handle errors as best you can, and not use the C file manipulation
// functions, because that would be cheating, and cheating’s bad, m’kay?
// You will turn in some test files to show your program works.
