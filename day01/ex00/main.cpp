#include "Pony.hpp"

int main()
{
	
}

// An easy one, to start with.
// Make a Pony class, containing whatever you think adequately describes a pony. Then,
// create two functions, ponyOnTheHeap and ponyOnTheStack, in which you will allocate a
// Pony, and make it do some stuff.
// Of course, in the first one, the Pony must be allocated on the heap, on in the second
// one it must be allocated on the stack.
// You will provide a main with enough code to prove what you made works as intended.
// In both cases, the Pony objects must not exist after the function hands off control.
// (Your main will also have to demonstrate this during the correction!)
