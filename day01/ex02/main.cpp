// First, make a Zombie class. Make it contain a type, and a name (at least), and add
// an announce() member function, that will output something along the lines of:
// <name (type)> Braiiiiiiinnnssss...
// Whatever you want, really, as long as you output the name and type of the Zombie.
// After this, you will create a ZombieEvent class. It will have a setZombieType function, that will store a type in the object, and a function Zombie* newZombie(std::string
// name) that will create a Zombie with the chosen type, name it, and return it.
// You will also make a randomChump function, that will create a Zombie with a random
// name, and make it announce itself. Whatever "random" method you choose, truly random names or a random choice from a pool of names, is fine.
// You must turn in a full program, main included, with enough to prove that what
// you made works as required. For example, make your newly created Zombies announce
// themselves.
// Now the actual point of the exercise: Your Zombies must be destroyed at appropriate
// times (so, when they are not needed anymore). They must also be allocated in the appropriate fashion: Some times itâ€™s appropriate to have them on the stack, at other times
// the heap is a better choice. You will have to justify what you did to get a positive grade.
