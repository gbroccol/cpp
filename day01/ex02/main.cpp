// You must turn in a full program, main included, with enough to prove that what
// you made works as required. For example, make your newly created Zombies announce
// themselves.
// Now the actual point of the exercise: Your Zombies must be destroyed at appropriate
// times (so, when they are not needed anymore). They must also be allocated in the appropriate fashion: 
// Some times itâ€™s appropriate to have them on the stack, at other times
// the heap is a better choice. You will have to justify what you did to get a positive grade.
