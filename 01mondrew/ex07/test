No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.

Fear is the path to the dark side.
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.
Hate leads to suffering.

Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.
Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight.
If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny,
consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wanâ€™s apprentice.
